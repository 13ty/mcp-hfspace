# mcp-hfspace MCP Server ðŸ¤—

Connect to [HuggingFace Spaces](https://huggingface.co/)  with minimial configuration needed simply add your spaces and go!.


If no spaces are specified, connects to `evalstate/FLUX.1-schnell` image generator by default.

@llmindset/mcp-hfspace.



## Basic setup

Supply a list of HuggingFace spaces in the arguments. mcp-hfspace will usually be able to find the most appropriate endpoint and automatically configure for usage.

For example: `.../build/index.js Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct evalstate/`

It is strongly recommended to set a Working Directory for handling upload and download of images and other file-based content. Do that with the `--work-dir` argument or `MCP_HF_WORK_DIR` environment variable. The current working directory is used by default which for Claude on Windows is `TODO` and on MacOS is `TODO`.

To access private spaces, use `--hf-token` argument or `HF_TOKEN` environment variable to set your HuggingFace token.

## File Handling and Claude Desktop Mode

### Example 1 - Image Generation (Download Image / Claude Vision)

By default, files are . Available files in the root of the . 

### Example 2 - Text-to-Speech (Download Audio)

### Example 3 - Speech-to-Text (Upload Audio)

### Example 4 - Image-to-Image

### Specifying API Endpoint

If you need, you can specify a specific API Endpoint by adding it to the spacename. So rather than passing in `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct` you would use `Qwen/Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct/model_chat`.

### Specifying HuggingFace Token

`HF_TOKEN` environment variable to set your Hugging Face token.

## Recommended Spaces

Some recommended spaces to try:

- shuttleai/shuttle-3.1-aesthetic

## Features

### Claude Desktop Mode

By default, the Server operates in _Claude Desktop Mode_. In this mode, Images are returned directly in the tool responses, while other binaries are saved in the working folder and a message is returned with the URI. 

Text Content is returned as a Text content type.

For other Client deployments, you will probably want the default behaviour so use --desktop-mode=false or CLAUDE_DESKTOP_MODE=false.


## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Build the server:#

```bash
npm run build
```

For development with auto-rebuild:

```bash
npm run watch
```

## Installation

To use with Claude Desktop, add the server config:

On MacOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
On Windows: `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcp-hfspace": {
      "command": "/path/to/mcp-hfspace/build/index.js"
      "args:" [
        "Qwen/Qwen2-72B-Instruct",
        "black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-schnell"
        ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Debugging

Since MCP servers communicate over stdio, debugging can be challenging. We recommend using the [MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), which is available as a package script:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

The Inspector will provide a URL to access debugging tools in your browser.

### Known Issues and Limitations
